## DevOps Automation Setup Script

This script automates the installation of essential DevOps tools on a fresh Linux server. It ensures a consistent setup of the necessary packages to streamline the process of provisioning environments for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), containerization, infrastructure management, and monitoring.

## 🚀 Tools Installed:
Git - Version control for source code management.
Docker - Containerization platform to build, run, and share applications.
Kubernetes - Orchestration platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
Terraform - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool to define and provision infrastructure.
Jenkins - Automation server to build, test, and deploy software.
Prometheus - Monitoring system and time-series database.
Grafana - Data visualization and monitoring tool for cloud-native applications.

## 📋 Prerequisites:

A fresh Linux server (Ubuntu/Debian-based distributions).
A user with sudo privileges.
